      "shortDescription": "This is an AEM component that uses PIM Model Group data to drive selections.",
      "longDescription": "",
      "problem": "The previous selector tools were built using hard coded data. This made it difficult to maintain and update the data as products changed. The business team wanted to be able to update the data in PIM and have it automatically reflected in the selector tool. The business team also wanted to be able to create new selector tools for new product lines without having to involve the development team. The business team were already utilizing PIM Model Groups to manage product data for product family pages and it was thought these could also be used to drive the selector tools.",
      "solution": "To solve this issue I developed a new AEM component that would pull data from PIM Model Groups That were already being pushed into AEM. The component would then use this data to build the selector tool dynamically. This allowed the business team to update the data in PIM and have it automatically reflected in the selector tool. The component was also designed to be reusable, allowing the business team to create new selector tools for new product lines without having to involve the development team.",

      "problem": "The business team was originally utilizing Flash and Excel based selector tools. Flash was being obsoleted and the Excel tools were not user friendly. The business team wanted a more modern and user friendly solution that would be easy to maintain and update.",
      "solution": "I developed a new solution using React and OpenCPQ. The new solution was a single page application that would utilize a JSON structure to dynamically build the selector tool options. OpenCPQ was used for the base structure of state management and user interface. The new solution was also designed to be user friendly, with a modern and intuitive interface. One of the original requirements was that the new tool be usable offline via a portal app that the company was using. This is what drove the decision to use JSON for the data as well as tab delimited text files for pulling pricing information. The new solution was well received by the business team and has been successfully implemented for several customizable product lines.",

      "problem": "There were a few of sites that were built on an older technology stack that was no longer supported. The business team wanted to migrate these sites to AEM Edge Delivery to take advantage of the new features and capabilities. THis would also give more flexibility to the marketing team to make updates and changes to the site without having to involve the development team.",
      "solution": "Three sites were migrated to AEM Edge Delivery. The migration process involved recreating the site structure and content in AEM Edge Delivery. The basic structure of the sites were kept the same with some new designs being implemented using the Edge Delivery custom blocks. Data and page structure is now being handled via Word docs and Excel Files in a Sharepoint folder. The migration process was successful and the new sites have been well received by the business team. Two of the URLs for these sites are below as the third is internal only.",

During my time on this project I was involved in a migration to the Adobe Cloud platform. This involved updating the site to be compatible with the new platform, as well as testing and troubleshooting any issues that arose during the migration process. Additionally I have worked on streamlining the Javascript build and deploy process, reducing the page load time by excluding unnecessary javascript. I have also worked closely with marketing to develop new custom components and page layouts. Overall, my work on this project has helped to improve the user experience and functionality of the site, while also ensuring that it remains up-to-date with the latest web technologies.",
