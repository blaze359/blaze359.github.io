  "description": "My name is Jameson Arndt. I am a full stack developer with a passion for front end development. I have been working in IT for 21+ years with the last 8+ years officially in software development. Even before officially working as a web developer I have been building web pages and applications whenever possible since the late 90's. I have worked in a variety of languages and technologies over the years giving me a well rounded background in software development. My current focus is on modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks and libraries such as React, Next.js, and Node.js.",
